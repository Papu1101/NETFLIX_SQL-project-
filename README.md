## NETFLIX_SQL-project-
Netflix SQL Project – Data cleaning and analysis of Netflix titles using PostgreSQL. Includes queries on ratings, movies vs TV shows, top countries, longest movies, and multi-season shows.

##Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the Netflix dataset using PostgreSQL, focusing on data cleaning and SQL queries to extract meaningful insights about movies, TV shows, ratings, genres, and actors.

✅ What We Solved

We wrote SQL queries to answer the following business questions:

Count the number of Movies vs TV Shows

Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows

List all movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)

Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix

Identify the longest movie

Find content added in the last 5 years

Find all the movies/TV shows by director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

List all TV shows with more than 5 seasons

Count the number of content items in each genre

Find the top 10 actors who have appeared in the highest number of movies produced in India

 ##Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to clean, transform, and analyze real-world datasets. By applying grouping, filtering, ranking, and window functions, we were able to uncover valuable insights about Netflix content distribution, trends, and patterns. This project not only highlights strong SQL querying skills but also serves as a portfolio-ready case study in data analysis.
